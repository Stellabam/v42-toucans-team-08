###UPDATES

- [x] I have fixed the overflow that used to occur when the joke was too long,
      that is not the case anymore.
- [x] I had added all the categories we need to be able to search for using the
      `category api`
- [x] I modified a few colours.
- [x] I also temporarily removed our hero section for testing purposes/and until
      we have a better plan for it. Its still in the HTML though.
- [x] I have added EXO as the default font.
- [x] Its responsive in that upto 1200px screen the layout does not "break" and
      look jumbled etc. / and looks good at 375px small screen too. However, I
      changed the way the bar looks -- so, will need to fix that to maintain the
      RD.
- [x] Removed the H1 that said "Chuck Norris Facts" - because of our logo I felt
      we no longer needed that. Please advise however. :)
- [x] ...list will be decided tonight (31st Jan 2023)

###darkmode branch

- [x] Added a darkmode scheme! Its to be worked, on, using other methods but
      this is what I have, please provide feedback and required changes. :)
- [x] Added a clicky too!

- [ ] I need to add the sun icon when its darkmode to toggle back -- will update
      when I have
- [ ] If we are okay with the current scheme and no changes are needed I will do
      this in a better way I read on MDN earlier. :)
