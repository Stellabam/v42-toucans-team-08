# Kirsten Updates / 7.Feb 2023

## Changes made

- [x] Removed the button for the search query, just type. / it works now.
- [x] Dark mode/light mode icon toggles, but I am 100% positive there is an
      easier/and also more concise and proper way to do this, I just do not know
      it, and I will look into it if time permits. Right now, it works. Please,
      as always, know a better way, `just do it`
- [x] fixed the overflow on the joke box ... it can now go on for days.. that is
      likel bad though.
- [x] the searched for now shows categories, needs work though x
