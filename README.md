#Darkmode branch

- [x] Added a darkmode scheme! Its to be worked, on, using other methods but
      this is what I have, please provide feedback and required changes. :)
- [x] Added a clicky too!

- [ ] I need to add the sun icon when its darkmode to toggle back -- will update
      when I have
- [ ] If we are okay with the current scheme and no changes are needed I will do
      this in a better way I read on MDN earlier. :)
- [ ] I also have to figure out how to make the white on logo not an issue, any ideas/feedback if you can please. :)
