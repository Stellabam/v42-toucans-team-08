# Kirsten Updates / 9.Feb 2023

## Changes made

- [x] I added a keyword for when the random fact is clicked "You searched a
      random fact" so its cnsistent with what we have done.
- [x] I removed lots of the comments I had left in our CSS file -- its really
      messy, if you feel you have clean that up, please feel free to do whatever
      you like. `<3`
- [x] I fixed the reload when a user hit enter / it was being caused by the
      default behaviour of forms when you submit / so e.preventDefault() on a
      form addEventlisner I added seems to have done the trick.
- [x] I have merged Stellas emoji additons to this branch so this is the most
      current branch in our team project. :)
- [x] Added github icon with a link to our team repo.
