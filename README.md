#CategoryAPI

- [x] I have added a ternary to check if the value of the search bar is true and
      if so, then the function to search the api via a query string runs if not
      it doesnt, it was causing a console log error without this.
- [x] Functional category API call when button is clicked -- also has a ternary due to it sharing the same button.
