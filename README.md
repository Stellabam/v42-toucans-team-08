# Kirsten Updates / 3.Feb 2023

## Changes made

- [x] I have streamlined our DARKMODE CSS! I was not happy with it, so I learned
      some SCSS basics and its better now. It also reduced the amount of
      `getElementByID`s in our JavaScript File :)
- [x] I updated the logo to a different one :( I know we had never really voted,
      like we had planned to, but, still feel bad about the change, but, this
      one was easier to remove the BG on and since I didn't really find a
      solution since yesterday... I went with it. If ya'll know a better way, go
      right on ahead and change please. That would be awesome. :)
- [x] I have updated the FILE STRUCTURE.
